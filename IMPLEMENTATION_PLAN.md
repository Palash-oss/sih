# Health Dashboard Revamp: Implementation Plan

## 1. Database Selection & Setup
- **Choose MongoDB** for flexible, schema-less storage of user health logs and easy integration with chat data.
- Set up MongoDB Atlas (cloud) or local MongoDB instance.
- Update `.env` with MongoDB connection string.

## 2. Backend API Design
- Use **Flask** (or FastAPI) for backend.
- Create endpoints for:
  - User registration/login (phone number + Aadhaar).
  - Logging health events (from chatbot or manual entry).
  - Fetching user health data for dashboard.
- Integrate chatbot to parse user messages and extract health events.

## 3. Authentication
- Implement simple authentication using phone number and Aadhaar.
- Use OTP (mock or real) for phone verification.

## 4. Frontend Design
- Use **React** for frontend.
- Pages/components:
  - Login/Signup (phone + Aadhaar).
  - Dashboard (show health logs, charts).
  - Chatbot interface (send health updates).

## 5. Chatbot Integration
- Connect chatbot UI to backend.
- On user message (e.g., "I have fever today"), extract health event and log it with date.

## 6. Dashboard Data Visualization
- Fetch health logs from backend.
- Display as list and simple charts (e.g., fever occurrences over time).

## 7. Testing & Refinement
- Test flows: signup, login, chatbot entry, dashboard display.
- Refine UI for simplicity and accessibility (large buttons, clear text).
